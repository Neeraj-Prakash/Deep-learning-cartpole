# Deep-learning-cartpole  
This is a program that plays the Cartpole game from OpenAI.  
We use a Deep Neural Network to play the game.  
You can modify the number of layers and play around with the variables to get better results. 
Go ahead and try it.  
  
  
This program should run on any machine having python 3.x installed.  
Although you will need the following libraries of python3 to run it.  
-> Tensorflow (cpu or gpu )  
-> gym (the openai game environment)  
-> tflearn
if you dont have the above libraries . just a quick "pip install <library_name>" will do the trick.
